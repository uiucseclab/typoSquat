# typoSquat
This set of extensions helps to prevent the user from accidentily traveling to malicious websites that are "typosquatting" an a very similar, but slightly different (like www.groogle.com), url. The extension checks the entered address against a list of very common websites and US bank websites and looks for slight errors. If the entered site is determined to be in error, the user is prompted about the error before the browser is allowed to resolve the site.

The firefox extension is installed from the about:addons page. From the gear menu, select install addon from file and designate the "fftypo-0.0.1-fx.xpi" file under the fftypo folder.

The chrome extension can be installed by adding the typoSquatterDetector folder as an unpacked extension under developer mode.
